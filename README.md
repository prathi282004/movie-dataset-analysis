## 📌 Project Title  
**Movie Dataset Analysis**  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project analyzes a **movie dataset (CSV file)** and calculates a variety of statistical measures to understand trends and relationships within the data.  

The analysis includes:  
- **Basic Statistics:** Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, and Standard Deviation for selected properties.  
- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  - Property Prices  
  - Circle Area  
  - Health Data  
  - Employee Happiness  
  - Investment  

The goal is to explore how different variables are related and extract insights from the dataset using Python and data analysis libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
